# Punches Landed Graph

**This Python script generates a graph of the punches landed by two boxers in each round of a boxing game and saves it as an SVG file. The graph is created using the Matplotlib library and can be customized with different data and formatting options.**

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the punches_landed_graph.py file in a text editor or IDE.
3. Modify the boxer1 and boxer2 lists to include your own data for punches landed in each round. Make sure the lists have the same length and are in the same order.
4. Run the script using the command 'python punches_landed_graph.py' in a terminal or command prompt.
5. The script will generate a graph of the punches landed by each boxer in each round and save it as an SVG file named punches_landed_graph.svg in the same directory as the script. You can open the SVG file in a web browser or a vector graphics editor to view and edit the image. You can customize the filename and path for the SVG file by modifying the savefig() function in the code.
